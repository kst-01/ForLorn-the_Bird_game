# ForLorn-the_Bird_game


## Description

This repo is just a simple python game which uses the pygame library to function.
It is a really basic game just like flappy bird, but in this you can customize your birds (custom images) and change colours of the pipes and background. Or change the screen sizes for better device compatabilities.

## How to Run

1.) Just download the "maincode.py" file or simply copy paste the code into another file.<br>
2.) Then check in your terminal if you have python installed using the command, "python --version", if you see something like "Python 3.13.9" you are good to go.<br>
3.) Next install pygame library using this command, "pip install pygame".<br>
4.) At last make sure to add your image file's path(directory inside inverted commas) in line 31.

## Customising stuff

You can add your custom image's directory in line 31.<br>
You can customise the colors and color values.<br>
You can customise the screen, width and height.<br>


This simple game is created only for fun purposes, following multiple memes and funny videos are going viral on the Instagram app.
